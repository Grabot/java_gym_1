Java gym challenge
===============================

Welcome to the next Java Gym challenge!

The challenge
-------------------------------

You are given a large number of 3-dimensional points. Find the pair of points that has the smallest separation.

But here's the catch: you should compute your answer within 500 ms for 100.000 points, on a Keylane laptop.

Details:

* Startup time of the JVM is not counted towards the 500ms.
* Coordinates are triples of finite 64-bit doubles.
* The points are randomly distributed, for some distribution.
* If there is more than one closest pair, you can pick either one.
* You may assume that there are at least 3 points, and no null values.
* Euclidean distance is used (the normal, "Pythagoras" way)

How to join
-------------------------------

* Clone this project. If you use IntelliJ, choose file > new > project from version control -> github. Enter the url you find at the top of the page.
* Implement the class `src/main/java/javagym/Solution.java` to solve the puzzle. Make sure the tests pass!
* If you want to commit your code and have a Github account, you can 'fork' this project and commit to that.
